    Exchange <: ProblemSolvingStrategy

Find an optimal design by ascending the Gateaux derivative of the objective function.

This is a variant of the basic idea in [^YBT13].

    Improve the `candidate` design by repeating the following `steps` times,
    starting with `r = candidate`:

     1. [`simplify`](@ref) the design `r`, passing along `sargs`.
     2. Use `optimizer_direction` to find the direction (one-point design / Dirac measure) `d`
        of highest [`gateauxderivative`](@ref) at `r`.
        The vector of `prototypes` that is used for initializing `optimizer_direction`
        is constructed from one-point designs at the design points of `r`.
        See the [`Optimizer`](@ref)s for algorithm-specific details.
     3. Use `optimizer_weight` to re-calculcate optimal weights
        of a [`mixture`](@ref) of `r` and `d` for the [`DesignCriterion`](@ref).
        This is implemented as a call to [`solve`](@ref)
        with the [`DirectMaximization`](@ref) strategy
        and with all of the design points of `r` kept fixed.
     4. Set `r` to the result of step 3.

    The return value of [`solve`](@ref) for this strategy is an [`ExchangeResult`](@ref).
