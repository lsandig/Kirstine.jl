# Kirstine.jl

*Bayesian Optimal Design for Nonlinear Regression.*

```@eval
import Pkg, Markdown
ver = Pkg.project().version
Markdown.MD("Version $(ver)")
```

## Project Status

Beta.
Mostly stable, breaking changes will be mostly cosmetic.

## Features

  - arbitrary nonlinear regression models
  - scalar or vector-valued response variable
  - variance-covariance matrix may depend on covariate
  - Bayesian and locally optimal design
  - design criteria: D, A
  - separation of design variables and model covariates
  - particle swarm optimization
  - direct maximization and exchange algorithm
  - modular and extendable
  - minimal dependencies

## Installation

Kirstine.jl is in the [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) Julia package registry.
You can install it with

```julia
Pkg.add("Kirstine")
```

Alternatively,
you can get it directly from sourcehut:

```julia
Pkg.add(url = "https://git.sr.ht/~lsandig/Kirstine.jl")
```

## Documentation

To get started, read the [tutorial](tutorial.md).

Familiarity with the following topics is required:

  - Nonlinear design theory, e.g.
    
      + Chapter 2 from Fedorov/Leonov's book[^FL13] for the general theory
      + Chaloner/Verdinelli's review article[^CV95] for the Bayesian approach
    
    (There is also an overview of the [notation](math.md) used in this package.)

  - Julia's [type system](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/types/)
    and adding [methods](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/methods/)
    for user-defined types.

## License

Kirstine.jl is free and open source software.
The code is licensed under GPL-3.0 or later,

## Rationale

Why another package for optimal design?
Currently, `R` packages for design with nonlinear regression have to make a compromise between flexibility
(allow arbitrary models written in `R`)
and execution speed
(implement only a few models in `C`).
In Julia, we can write both concise high-level code and efficient low-level code in the same language.
This way,
Kirstine.jl attempts to provide applied statisticians with a tool
for efficiently finding designs for arbitrarily complex nonlinear regression models.

Note that the `Julia` package [ExperimentalDesign.jl](https://github.com/phrb/ExperimentalDesign.jl)
and most of the [design packages on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/view=ExperimentalDesign)
are for finding block, factorial, or response-surface designs.
These are different tasks than what Kirstine.jl attempts to do.
